# DriverPass Project

## Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
The DriverPass project involved creating an online platform for DriverPass, a company that helps students prepare for their driving tests. They wanted a system where customers could sign up, book driving lessons, access online courses, and take practice tests. The system needed to support different roles like administrators, IT officers, secretaries, and customers, each with specific access and features.

## What did you do particularly well?
I excelled at creating clear and detailed UML diagrams. These diagrams made it easy to understand how the system would work and made sure that all user requirements were met.

## If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
If I could revise one part of my work, it would be the sequence diagram. I would add more details about customer interactions, such as choosing a training package and making payments, to give a fuller picture of the user experience and system operations.

## How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
To understand the user's needs, I carefully reviewed the interview transcript and requirements from the client. I identified important functions and user interactions and turned them into detailed system diagrams. Considering user needs is vital because it made sure the system is easy to use, meets their expectations, and effectively addresses their problems.

## How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
When designing software, I focus on understanding the user's requirements and creating detailed diagrams to visualize the system. In the future, I would use methods like user story mapping and iterative prototyping to refine the design based on user feedback. Regular reviews with stakeholders will help make sure the design remains aligned with their needs and expectations.
